<h2>The scenario</h2>

<p>So I want to backup my AppVms in Qubes. Obviously it makes sense, to encrypt the resulting
backup file. Not just so a third party will hae problems decoding my private digital life
but also to ensure integraty. See also <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/backup-restore/">here</a></p>

<p>The catch: You should use a high entropy passphrase. But entering that on a regular basis 
didn't seem like it would work for me.</p>

<h2>The setup</h2>

<p>I use an external 1 TB HDD attached via usb. The HDD is attached as a block device to a special
<em>"backup"</em> AppVM. <em>backup</em> is obviously not connected to a NetVM and there is nothing special 
in it. </p>

<h2>How I use the backup Manager</h2>

<p>First, I use the Qubes VM Manager to attach the external HDD as a block device to the <em>backup</em> VM. </p>

<p>In it I run:</p>

<pre><code>sudo mount /dev/xvdi1 backup/
</code></pre>

<p>to mount the HDD in the <em>backup</em> folder (which obviously must be created first).</p>

<p>Then, from a dom0 console, I run </p>

<pre><code>qvm-run --pass-io vault-nw 'cat /home/user/.backup_key'
</code></pre>

<p>So, wait, what? </p>

<pre><code>qvm-run --pass-io
</code></pre>

<p>is used to copy file(content) between VMs. It can also be used to copy to dom0. </p>

<pre><code>vault-nw
</code></pre>

<p>is the source VM. In this case, it is my password manager VM.</p>

<pre><code>'cat /home/user/.backup_key'
</code></pre>

<p>This command is executed in the source VM (so in this example <em>vault-nw</em>). And the output
is displayed in the dom0 Terminal. Within the vault-nw I exported my laptop backup key to a plain
text file, called <em>.backup_key</em>. </p>

<p>The content is displayed in dom0 Terminal (which is considered ultimatly trusted) and can be copied through
a simple right click.</p>

<p>In the Qubes VM Manager I shutdown every VM that I want to save, then go to System->Backup VMs.
From there I choose all the VMs to backup. Clicking on Next will show the Dialog, where Qubes
wants to know, where to backup to. Here comes the backup VM handy. Here I choose the <em>backup</em> VM 
as a target and</p>

<pre><code>/home/user/backup/
</code></pre>

<p>as the backup folder. (You remember? The external HDD was mounted here within the <em>backup</em> VM)</p>

<p>Next, I copy/paste the backup key to the dialog and click next. The backup starts.</p>

<h2>Pitfalls</h2>

<p>So, the worst case happend and you need to restore your backup. But wait, what was that horrible
long, high entropy passphrase again? Yeah, right, it is in my password-vault VM. But where is that?
In my backup....</p>

<p>So you see, that sucks.</p>

<p>You should therefore have your passphrase somewhere seperate than <em>within</em> your backup.</p>

<p>I personally use <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org">pass</a> and setup a git repository on my homeserver to sync
to. But that is a story for another blog.</p>

<p>If you have questions or remarks, just drop me an email. </p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Florian</p>
